			<h3>Top 5 programming language you should know.</h3>
			<caption> 
					According to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Kids around the world should learn to program instead of learning any second language. Recently, The IT sector was in the news after many industrialists mentioned that machine learning or artificial intelligence will eat the jobs of persons working in these sectors but these statements are not completely true. Bill Gates, Co-founder of Microsoft and Billionaire, in an interview to LinkedIn Executive, told that people with skills related to coding or people able to even think like a professional programmer, will have a demand in future.
					This record is according to research of <a href ="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index"> TIOBE</a> index in October 2018.
